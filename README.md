# MoonForms Installation Guide

First, you need to buy MoonForms. So to buy it, go to [here](https://www.roblox.com/game-pass/1565016771/MoonForms).

Once you bought it, open up [this game](https://www.roblox.com/games/113152081650502/Moon-Shopping-Center#!/about) and press on MoonForms. This will show you random letters. This is not random though.

It's a key. Once you have the key, go to "sites.google.com/view/[Key]/home". Make sure to replace '[Key]" with the actual key.

Now once you have gone to the website, click on download. Then click on continue, then download the file from google drive.

Okay, almost done! We need to install the plugin. First, make a game and click on "Plugins > Plugins Folder". Then drag the file into the plugins folder.

# Usage Guide

(I'm too lazy so ima tell you how to make a Form.)

To make a form just go to the plugins tab, then click Form.
